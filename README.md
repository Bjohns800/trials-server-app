# Trials Server Scoring Application

This repo serves as a snapshot into the development of an application to do the server side processing and formatting of results, to be used in conjunction with an android app to add electronic live scoring to motorcycle trials.

This project is curently still in development.

The goal of this project is to be an open source solution that event organisers can use the applications to officiate thier local trials events.
